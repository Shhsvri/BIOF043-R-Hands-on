# BIOF043-R-Hands-on

## Agenda
Today, we are going to learn about RMarkdown and analyze clinical and genomic 
data using what we have learned in the past three days and generate beautiful 
markdown reports that you could share with collaborators or use for publications.

## RMarkdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that includes some HTML functionality. In R, markdown has been adopted to wrap R code and results into the same document. Similar to RScripts that we have been using, RMarkdown includes the R code. To it, you could add all the plots, tables, and results you generate in your R Console. This is very useful in making your work reproducible. With RMarkdown, you could share your workflow and your results in the same document.

### Why use RMarkdown?

Using R Markdown you’ll be able to generate reports straight from your R code, documenting your work — and its results. Finally, you could export your work as an HTML, pdf, slideshow, or Microsoft Word document.

R Markdown integrates a number of R packages and external tools. This means that help is, by-and-large, not available through ?. Instead, as you work through this chapter, and use R Markdown in the future, keep these resources close to hand:

- R Markdown Cheat Sheet: Help > Cheatsheets > R Markdown Cheat Sheet,
- R Markdown Reference Guide: Help > Cheatsheets > R Markdown Reference Guide.
