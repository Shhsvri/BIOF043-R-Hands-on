# BIOF043-R-Hands-on
## Day4: Extras and Capstone Projects

### Agenda
Today, we are going to learn about RMarkdown and analyze clinical and genomic 
data using what we have learned in the past three days and generate beautiful 
markdown reports that you could share with collaborators or use for publications.

Then, we will have a final project:

From Medicare-Part-D data, we will generate visualizations and reports

Before we start, we need to cover the following concepts:

- [Importing Data](lectures/import.md)
