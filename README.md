# BIOF043-R-Hands-on
## Day4: Extras and Capstone Projects

### Agenda
Today, we are going to learn about RMarkdown and analyze clinical and genomic 
data using what we have learned in the past three days and generate beautiful 
markdown reports that you could share with collaborators or use for publications.

Then, we will have two projects:

1. From Medicare-Part-D data, we will generate visualizations and reports
showing the states that prescribe **Buprenorphine** the most, per capita.

2. From publicly available RNAseq data, we will find a list of differentially
expressed genes comparing our study and control samples.
